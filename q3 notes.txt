DELETE ROW CAUSES

color_functions.py", line 36, in routes_color
              if e_ch>next_s_ch: #end_ch of row>s_ch of next row
             TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'




ideas


seperate coverage into lengths&missing sections and benchmarks


set to one way right click option for requested:
	update network set one_way=True where sec=s;delete from requested where sec=s and reversed


qsqltable subclass with 
set color_function(func)
set editable(col)
set_sort(cols)


order requested by multiple columns?

add no_correction option to season enum

Cancellable progress dialogs for refit_run,refit_runs,upload_runs

write user guide.

fix setup_database

possibilities
schema for tool? like
CREATE SCHEMA grip_tester_tool;
SET search_path TO grip_tester_tool, public;

add no_correction option to season enum

always use start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch.autofit can add these.
pro:
	better where points are same
con:
	roundabouts
	adding/editing rows harder



doing benchmarks in view. can delete table.
