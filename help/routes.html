        <p> Table routes is used in the  <a href="fitting.html">fitting process</a> to describe how to fit readings to network. It can be edited through the 'fitting' tab.<p>
		<p>created as:<p>
		<object data="../sql_scripts/setup_database/init_routes.txt" type="text/plain" typemustmatch="" width="800" style="height: 400px"></object>

		<p>columns:<p>
		<p>-	sec = section label. Needs to be in <a href="network.html">network</a> <p>
		<p>-	reversed=survey in opposite direction to section<p>
		<p>-	xsp <p>
		<p>-	run:needs to be in <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a> <p>
		<p>-	s,e=f_line where run enters/leaves section. 
		<p>-	note=note for benefit of person fitting. Autofit adds rows with note of 'auto'.
		<p>-	pk=primary key.
		<p>-	start_sec_ch,end_sec_ch: Section chainages where run enters/leaves section. Can be used to calculate section chainage.
		

        <h3 id="fitting">Routes and Fitting</h3>


		
		<p> Readings in run with s<=f_line<=e are fit to section<p>
		<p>start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch only need to be set where the gps is inaccurate.
		Where they are valid (>=0)they are used to calculate section chainages. Otherwise the closest point on the section to the reading is used.<p>
	
		<P>The autofit button will automatically create the route for the selected run. It is likely to make mistakes where the nearest section to a reading is not the correct one or where the gps is inaccurate.<P>
		<P>Autofit does not work out xsp. Do this by editing table in plugin or with update statement.<P>
