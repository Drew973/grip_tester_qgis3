        <h4 id="initial_fit">Initial fit</h4>

		<p> Table <a href="fitted.html">fitted</a> is created by joining  readings( <a href="r.html">table r</a> ) to the <a href="routes.html">routes table</a> <p>
		<p> Section chainage is calculated using closest point of section to reading or start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch only. <p>

		
        <h4 id="correcting for season">Correcting for Season</h4>

		<p> Where the section is marked as a benchmark in <a href="network.html">network</a> and the run is marked as a benchmark in <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a>
		readings from fitted are inserted into the <a href="benchmarks.html">benchmarks table</a>.
		The benchmarks table is used to calculate <a href="correction_factors.html">seasonal correction factors</a>.
		These correction factors and season from <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a> are used to update fitted, calculating sfc from gn.
		<p>


        <h4 id="resizing">Resizing</h4>

		<p> Table <a href="resized.html">resized</a> is made by joining <a href="fitted.html">fitted</a> to 10m <a href="pieces.html">pieces</a> of requested sections.
			sfc is calculated as the mean sfc of all readings with section chainage within range. When there are no readings in range readings from 10m either side are used.
